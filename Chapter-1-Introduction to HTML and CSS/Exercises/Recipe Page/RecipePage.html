       <li>Dissolve the sugar, yeast, and salt in the lukewarm water (and olive oil, if you're using it). </li> <br>
       <li>Add the flour and Pizza Dough Flavor, starting with 5 1/2 cups (660g) flour and adding more as necessary to make a soft, smooth dough.</li> <br>
       <li>Knead by hand on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and slightly sticky. add more if its too wet.</li> <br>
       <li>Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in it, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with plastic wrap. For a quick rise, let it sit in a warm place (75°F-85°F) for 1.5 hours.</li> <br>
       <li>Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces, for medium-crust pizza; or three pieces, for thicker crusts. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece, on a lightly greased surface, into a circle to fit a 12" pizza pan. Let the dough rest several times to relax it </li> <br>
       <li>Place the rounds on pizza pans; on baking sheets; or, if you have a pizza stone in your oven, on parchment.</li> <br>
       <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F and preaping your toppings.</li> <br>
       <li>Brush each crust with a bit of olive oil; spread tomato sauce lightly over the surface. Add toppings on pizza. and finish with cheese.</li> <br>
       <li>Bake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown, the toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. Remove the pizzas from the oven.</li> <br>
       <li>Immediately transfer pizzas to a cooling rack, so their bottoms don't get soggy for 10 miuntes.</li> <br>
